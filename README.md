# ðŸ©º Lung Cancer Detection using Random Forest

This project focuses on early-stage **lung cancer detection** using the **Random Forest Classifier**, a robust ensemble learning method. Built with Python, the project leverages widely used libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** for data handling, visualization, and model building.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in increasing survival rates. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the presence of lung cancer based on medical features from a dataset.

## ðŸš€ Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) â€“ for ML algorithms
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) â€“ for data manipulation
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) â€“ for numerical computations
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) â€“ for plotting graphs
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) â€“ for data visualization

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- The dataset contains medical attributes that may influence lung cancer diagnosis (such as age, smoking, chronic diseases, etc.).
- The target variable indicates whether the patient has lung cancer (`1`) or not (`0`).

## ðŸ§  Model Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**:  
  An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for more accurate and stable predictions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Workflow

1. **Data Collection** â€“ Import dataset using Pandas  
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handle missing values, encode categorical data, normalize if needed  
3. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** â€“ Visualize patterns with Seaborn & Matplotlib  
4. **Model Training** â€“ Train the Random Forest model on the data  
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Use metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall  
6. **Prediction** â€“ Test on new data and check performance
